# Prompt Dataset for COMPSAC 2025 Paper

This is the prompt dataset proposed in our paper:  
**"Optimization of Prompt Segmentation for Improving Event Recommendation Accuracy Using Generative Artificial Intelligence"**, accepted at **COMPSAC 2025**.
(ðŸ“„ The official paper link will be added here once available.)

It includes the following types of prompts:
- `EVENT RECOMMENDATION INITIAL PROMPT`
- `EVALUATION PROMPT`

All prompts were originally designed and used in **Japanese**.  
For clarity, we provide **both the original Japanese versions and their English translations**.  
Note that:
- All experiments were conducted using Japanese prompts and outputs.
- English versions are provided only for reference and were not used in the actual experiments.
