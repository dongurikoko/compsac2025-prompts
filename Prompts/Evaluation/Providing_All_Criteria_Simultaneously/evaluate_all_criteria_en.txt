# Evaluation Prompt : Providing All Criteria Simultaneously

*** Evaluation Criteria ***
• Personality Trait Inference
- Scoring Accuracy
Are the scores for each item (e.g., S1––S9) appropriate?
Are the calculated results for each personality trait (Agreeableness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Openness) valid?
Is the reasoning behind the assigned scores clear and reasonable based on the post content of the user?
Has reverse scoring been correctly applied?

- Accuracy of Score Calculation
Is the personality trait inference process accurate and compliant with the specified calculation formula?
Is the score calculation process explicitly documented, including mathematical expressions and explanations of intermediate steps?

• Preferences Inference
- Accuracy of Preference Inference
Have the preferences of the user been inferred appropriately based on their posts?
Is the inferred preference consistent with the post content of the user?

• Emotion Inference
- Accuracy of Emotion Detection
Is the identified emotion (e.g., joy, sadness, anxiety, anger) appropriate?
Is the inferred emotion logically supported by the specific content and context of the user’s posts?

- Empathy and Understanding
Does the output demonstrate empathy toward the identified emotion?
Does it reflect a deep understanding of the user's emotional state?

- Effectiveness of Advice
Are the suggestions and solutions provided based on the inferred emotions specific and actionable?

• Event Recommendation Relevance
- Accuracy of Classification Based on Personality Traits
Is the classification of events according to personality traits (Openness, Agreeableness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness) accurate?
Are the recommended event types aligned with the inferred personality traits?

- Consideration of Preferences and Emotions
Are the user's preferences and emotional states reflected in the event selection?  
Are there clear and specific reasons provided based on the user's preferences and emotions?

- Appropriateness of the Recommended Events  
Are the recommended events appropriate and likely to be of interest to the user?  
Are personality traits, preferences, and emotions all considered in a balanced manner?

- Persuasiveness of Recommendation Reasoning  
Are the reasons for recommending each event concrete and persuasive?  
Is it clearly explained why each event was selected?
